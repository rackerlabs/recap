## [0.8-2] - 2012-11-01
- Modified the call to mktemp so that it uses a template. This is to improve compatibility with RHEL 2.1

## [0.8] - 2012-11-01
- Modified the send_mail function so that it generates a random tmp directory to use rather than always writing to the same location

## [0.7] - 2012-11-01
- Added flag to perform snapshots. A snapshot is a one-time report that generates time-stamped output files. These files are not included in the output file rotation
- Added flag to perform a backup of the latest reports. There was an issue on some servers where the second "@reboot" command would not be executed from cron. This creates a time-stamped copy (similar to the snapshots above, but labeled "backup") of the latest set of report files
- Wrapped almost all functionality in bash functions to allow for more flexible execution of rs-sysmon functionality. This is still a mess and will continue to be addressed in future releases.
